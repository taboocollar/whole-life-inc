# Private Vault

This directory contains personal AI personas and private collections, separate from the main Whole Life Inc. project.

## Structure

- `personas/` - AI character personas and profiles

## Personas Collection

The personas directory contains detailed character profiles including:
- JSON format for structured data and potential integration
- Markdown format for human readability

Each persona includes comprehensive information about:
- Physical appearance and characteristics
- Background and origin story
- Personality traits and behaviors
- Interaction patterns and default behaviors

## Usage

You can view and interact with persona data using the `vault_reader.py` utility:

```bash
# List all available personas
python vault_reader.py

# Display a specific persona
python vault_reader.py nocturne-vaelis
```

The personas are stored in both JSON (for programmatic access) and Markdown (for human readability) formats.

## Privacy

This vault is intended as a personal collection and is separate from the main project functionality.
